# Railways-Price-Prediction

Problem Statement: Develop a machine learning model to predict the ticket price for Indian Railways based on various factors such as 'baseFare', 'reservationCharge', 'superfastCharge', 'serviceTax', 'cateringCharge', 'dynamicFare', 'duration', and 'distance'. The goal is to create a predictive model that can accurately estimate the ticket price by analyzing the relationships and patterns within these columns, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of fare predictions for passengers and stakeholders in the Indian Railways system.
